      <h1>THE FARM</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our self-serve farmstand at 165 Chestnut Hill Road Orange will re-open
        in early April. Thank you for your patronage, it means a lot. We were
        recently awarded a grant from the Harold Grinspoon Foundation Local Farm
        program that enables the purchase of a larger, upright refrigerator for
        our solar-powered farmstand! Can’t wait to get and install it and we
        think you will love it too.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Did you know there is a soil microbe that creates happiness? Are you
        interested in volunteering on our no-till human powered farm on Mondays
        and/or Tuesdays through the spring, summer, and fall? Grow through the
        seasons each week, as you experience a diversity of approaches to
        no-till farming for life! Volunteers may come either day, but
        consistency and commitment is important. We work hard with great
        conversation and offer you learning, lunch and some veggies to take
        home. Call Ricky at 978-544-7564 to talk about volunteering.
      </p>

        Seeds of Solidarity Farm was initiated in 1996, on land in the middle of
        the forest that had not been cultivated for many years, and the original
        inhabitants of the region being the Wampanoag, Nipmuc, and Pequoit
        people. A conservation restriction on our 30 acres ensures the land will
        always be used for agriculture, education, and wildlife habitat. With
        nature as teacher, the land has been transformed into fertile fields and
        hosts 5 solar hoophouses brimming with our signature greens, fruit and
        perennial crops, garlic and sacred, traditional crops such as Hopi blue
        and Narraganset flour corn. The tapestry of our site includes energy
        efficient and off the grid home, office, and farm outbuildings,
        including Solidarity Handworks, a solar powered farmstand, and
        celebration art and words of inspiration along the paths.

        With the growth in people wanting local food, we ask, ‘How can more
        people participate not only as consumers, but producers?’ To build local
        food self-reliance, we need accessible, affordable and yes, fun
        practices that mimic nature, help decentralize food production and
        engage more people in cultivating the earth in order to Grow Food
        Everywhere. We use cardboard on marginal land to foster worms, microbes
        and mychorrizal fungi that decompose the cardboard and build a fertile
        soil ecosystem. In addition to an increase in worm castings (poop),
        using cardboard as mulch helps balance moisture, keep weeds down, and
        create no-till carbon sinks that retain rather than release CO2 into the
        atmosphere. Cardboard- a waste product available in most communities– is
        key to growing gardens on lawns, lots, school yards, municipal buildings
        for opening up and improving plots of land.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        It is an honor to grow food in solidarity with small farmers around the
        world, and those everywhere helping to feed the people.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

      <h2>Growing Food</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Seeds of Solidarity Farm emphasizes soil building and worm production
        through permanent no-till raised beds and fields. We use cardboard,
        mulch, and cover crops to nourish and open up land and nourish the life
        in the soil. We’ve had great success transforming forested, acid land
        marginal for growing vegetables into balanced and rich agricultural
        soil. Without a need to till, there is no need for machinery that uses
        fossil fuels and release carbon when tilling; we grow in solidarity with
        the 80% of the world’s farmers that cultivate the earth with their
        hands. We use solar hoophouses to grow vibrant salad greens, spinach,
        and Asian greens from February through December, as well as tomatoes,
        peppers, and other hot weather crops. Hoophouses extend the growing
        season and protect from pests and weather extremes increasingly wrought
        by climate change. Increasingly, we grow sacred crops such as
        traditional corns, wheat, and tobacco.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our family farm is distinct from the non-profit organization, but serves
        as an educational space to share strategies for viable small scale
        intensive farming. After 25 years of marketing produce retail and
        wholesale, from farmers markets to restaurants, we now sell our produce
        exclusively at our farmstand and to our very local food coop. In
        addition, we cultivate over 14 varieties of garlic, sold at the North
        Quabbin Garlic and Arts Festival.
      </p>

        We are happy to share a few resources to support no-till farming and
        gardening for life, and efforts to Grow Food Everywhere!

      <h2>Solidarity Handworks Farmstand</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our sweet farmstand is located at our site, 165 Chestnut Hill Road,
        Orange. We are famous for our delicious salads and greens, grown in
        fertile soil in our solar greenhouses and available March through
        November. The farmstand is self-serve and our cooler is powered by a
        solar electric system. Heirloom and gorgeous vegetables fill the shelves
        at the height of the season. We sell most of our garlic at the North
        Quabbin Garlic and Arts Festival but any left will go in our farmstand
        in October for your planting and eating pleasure.

        As both farmer and artist, Ricky creates beautiful, sacred rustic pieces
        for custom order. Pieces are made from local red cedar, harvested with
        love, then crafted by hand into meditation benches, altars, tables, and
        coat racks, with beautiful inlays of blue corn and red pepper- looks
        like precious stone! All done with love, in a solar powered studio on
        our farm.
