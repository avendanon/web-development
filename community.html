        Seeds of Solidarity is based in the nine-town North Quabbin region of
        Western/Central Massachusetts. It is rich with natural beauty and
        hardworking people, and one of the poorest regions in the state. Years
        ago, the heart of the region was a fertile valley that was flooded to
        create the Quabbin Reservoir as water supply for Boston. This took the
        most fertile soil and vibrant livelihoods away. A mill economy supported
        our working class community for years until globalization took its toll.
        Seven of the nine towns in the North Quabbin area fall in the bottom
        fifteen percent of per capita incomes of 351 communities in the state.
        Free and reduced lunch rates have recently risen to an alarmingly high
        average of 60% in Orange and Athol, the two most populated towns in the
        region. Disease and health issues are severe and our region is hard hit
        by hunger and related social ills such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes.
